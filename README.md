# Loan-Default-Analysis
**Project: Loan Default Prediction**

**Objective:**
The "Loan Default Prediction" project focuses on leveraging historical data of bank customers to build a robust predictive model that identifies potential loan defaults. By analyzing various customer attributes such as Loan_ID, Gender, Married, Dependents, Education, Self_Employed, ApplicantIncome, Coapplicant Income, LoanAmount, Loan_Amount_Term, Credit_History, Property_Area, and Loan_Status, the project aims to enhance the bank's risk assessment capabilities and optimize lending strategies.

**Data Analysis and Processing:**
1. **Data Collection and Storage:**
   - Utilized banking Customer Relationship Management (CRM) systems to gather comprehensive customer data.
   - Analyzed, processed, and stored data in an SQL database for efficient retrieval and management.

2. **Feature Analysis:**
   - Explored various features such as gender, marital status, income, credit history, and property area to identify key predictors of loan default.

**Model Implementation:**
- **Random Forest Algorithm:**
  - Employed the Random Forest algorithm for its ability to handle complex datasets and capture non-linear relationships.
  - Utilized hyperparameter tuning to optimize the model's performance.

**Hyperparameter Tuning:**
Fine-tuned the Random Forest model by adjusting hyperparameters to enhance predictive accuracy:
- Tweaked parameters such as the number of trees, maximum depth, and minimum samples split to achieve optimal performance.

**Data Visualization:**
Utilized Seaborn and Matplotlib for comprehensive data visualization:
- Created visual representations of data distributions, correlations, and feature importance to aid in model interpretation.
- Visualized the impact of key features on loan default predictions.

**Metrics and Numbers:**
1. **Model Performance:**
   - Achieved a high accuracy rate, indicating the model's proficiency in correctly predicting loan defaults.

2. **Hyperparameter Tuning Results:**
   - Demonstrated improved model performance metrics such as precision, recall, and F1-score after hyperparameter tuning.

**Conclusion:**
The "Loan Default Prediction" project successfully implemented a Random Forest algorithm to predict potential loan defaults based on customer attributes. The combination of feature analysis, hyperparameter tuning, and advanced data visualization techniques contributed to the model's accuracy and interpretability. The insights gained from this project empower the bank to make data-driven decisions, optimize lending practices, and proactively manage risks associated with loan default scenarios.
